          <h3 className="about-card-title">Why I Built This</h3>
          <p className="about-card-text">
            Nerdnest was developed as both a portfolio project and a practical
            demonstration of my capabilities in building full-stack web
            applications. My key motivations were:
          </p>
          <ul className="about-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Demonstrating Technical Versatility:</strong> This project
              showcases my proficiency across the entire MERN stack (MongoDB,
              Express.js, React, Node.js). It demonstrates my ability to
              seamlessly integrate frontend and backend technologies, from
              crafting engaging user experiences to implementing complex
              database architecture and API integrations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Professional Development:</strong> Through this project, I
              deliberately challenged myself to explore advanced concepts in
              React development, modern authentication protocols, and
              performance optimization techniques. Each feature implementation
              served as an opportunity to deepen my understanding of
              contemporary web development practices and strengthen my
              problem-solving abilities.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="about-card-conclusion">
            In summary, Nerdnest is more than being merely a project â€” it stands
            as a testament to my capabilities as a full-stack developer and
            reflects my commitment to creating sophisticated, user-centered web
            applications that deliver exceptional experiences.
